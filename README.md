# Sample Hardhat Project

Node.js v20.12.2


This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a Hardhat Ignition module that deploys that contract.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat ignition deploy ./ignition/modules/Token.js --network sepolia
npx hardhat contract
```
